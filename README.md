#Big UInt OOP Project
This project, Big UInt OOP, is implemented in both Python and C++. The C++ version is the most comprehensive and is less prone to errors. Both versions operate in the same way and leverage the multiprocessing approach.

Python version utilizes the multiprocessing library, while C++ version uses pthread. If you need to use pthread, please follow the instructions in the following resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GdTcqE0iqg.
